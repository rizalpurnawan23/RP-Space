        Soil Stability Under Coal Embankment
    </h2>
    <p>
        <i>GEO2301 | 2023 | EN</i><br>
        This article presents a geotechnical analysis of soil stability for a coal embankment with the ground soil reinforced with 1.50 mm thick geomembrane in an industrial coal storeroom. This project incorporates PLAXIS 2D as the computational program for computing the soil stability. The conditions of the system are analysed against the full coal embankment, the full coal embankment combined with a wheel loader during operation, and against a half of coal embankment combined with a wheel loader during operation. The result shows that the maximum vertical displacement of all phases does not exceed the maximum allowed displacement, and the critical safety factor is strictly greater than the minimum required safety factor. It concludes that the coal embankment is stable. This article is intended as a portfolio, reflecting a problem as well as my approach to the solution from one of my past projects in geotechnical engineering.
