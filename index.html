                    Welcome to <b>RP-Space</b>—my personal blog and portfolio.
                    I am Rizal Purnawan, an independent researcher and
                    self-taught mathematician with a formal educational
                    background in civil engineering. This site serves as a
                    space where I explore ideas at the intersection of pure
                    theory and practical application—ranging from topology,
                    functional analysis, and optimization to machine learning
                    and computational modeling. It reflects my belief that
                    mathematics is not merely a tool, but a language for
                    understanding structure, complexity, and meaning in both
                    abstract and real-world problems—a language of far-reaching
                    elegance and beauty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, you will find a growing collection of thoughts,
                    research notes, and example projects—some emerging from
                    curiosity, others from challenges encountered in
                    mathematics, computation, or engineering. Whether
                    theoretical or applied, each piece is part of an ongoing
                    process: to think deeply, communicate clearly, and
                    contribute meaningfully to the broader dialogue across
                    disciplines.

            The idea in this article originated from my past civil
            engineering project, particularly when I was assigned
            for determining the foundation design of a tower crane
            structure used in my project. In order to do that, engineers
            typically compute the support reaction of the tower crane,
            then using the reaction forces to proceed with the design
            and analysis of the foundation. The common approach is;
            either modelling the structure of the tower crane—which is
            typically done using commercial software, or alternatively
            using a manual calculation which can be done with
            hand-writing or spreadsheet. The former is much more
            rigorous—providing reliability and high accuracy, faster,
            but yet quite expensive. The later is oversimplified—causing
            less-reliability and less accuracy, potentially taking
            longer time but relatively cheap.

                So, why do we not take a position in between such that our
                approach is modular and scalable for a similar calculation?
            </div>
            <p>
            To answer the question above, I propose to develop a Python
            module so that we can automate this task with a considerable
            rigor but is also very cheap—requiring only cognitive
            thinking, mathematics and coding skills. And the main
            strength of this approach is that the module is reproducible,
            similar to a commercial software. So, the next time we need
            to compute the support reaction of another tower crane, we
            can directly use the module.
            </p>

            I am always fascinated with developing the underpinning
            mathematical framework of the program that I will later
            develop. It is based on a few considerations: First, it gives
            a clear foundation to the program, grounded in mathematics.
            Second, it eases the algorithm development and coding process
            as a guide. In addition, the emergence bridge between pure
            mathematics and the applied problem presented by the
            mathematical framework adds elegance and a philosophical
            implication.
            </p>
            <p>
            This article emphasizes the mathematical structure that
            emerges from my development in the mathematical framework
            of the Python module for computing the tower crane support
            reaction. In particular, I use linear algebra for the model
            and a little functional analysis. Notably I present a
            bilinear map $\diamond_q$ which maps the product of
            $\mathbb{R}^q$ with a $q$-direct sum of 3D Eculidean spaces
            to a 3D Euclidean space, for any $q \in \mathbb{N}$. The map
            $\diamond_q$ may be equivalent to another established map,
            and it may be defined via the classical algebraic operation.
            It is analogous to an inner product, but is different in the
            traditional sense since the domain consists of different
            vector spaces. With $\diamond_q$, I can express the
            application of a load combination in the system as a
            bounded linear operator on the $q$-direct sum of 3D Euclidean
            spaces. I also present another map $\overline{\boxtimes}$
            which maps the product of a 3D Euclidean space with a
            $q$-direct sum of 3D Euclidean spaces to the $q$-direct sum
            via the classical cross product to integrate the moments in
            the system. The map $\overline{\boxtimes}$ is also bilinear,
            and it also possesses the antisymmetric property inherited
            from the cross product in the form of its counterpart
            $\underline{\boxtimes}$, which is also a bilinear map.
            I further investigate properties of this linear algebraic
            model.
